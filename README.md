# Module-15---Task-3
Network Design


This is my Network Design, as you can see I have 3 servers going into a switch with the switches go three ways, ontop you can see if goes though a firewall then a router 
then the router connects to the inernet, if you look down you can see the switch goe to the wireless router then the smartphones and laptops connect to the WAP.
Lastly you can see to the right the switch goes into another switch which the workstations and the printes can be hardwired in.
